BOTTLED PHP
===========



what is bottled php?
--------------------

bottled php is a collection of anonymous components.
This means, you can use several components side by side,
even different versions of the same component without the need
to lay hand on the component itself.

We dont want to solve a specific problem, it should only be a collection
of short scripts.



where do i find documentation for the components?
-------------------------------------------------

there is a phpunit test class for each component,
which shows usage of them.
